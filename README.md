# Web-Pages

(Netlify)Profile - Profile page of links to LinkedIn, GitHub, and HackerRank; React Project, Replit Python adventure story, and Trinket.io coding platform for Turtle art; and Videos that are not related to coding just one of my fun hobbies. All links should be functional and useable upon loading content.

The page was intended to be fun and different. I still tried to respect any that might not want this style and there are anchors useable in the top-navbar to speed through the page if desired. Everything shold be chosen by the user and can be cancelled at anytime.

KNOWN BUGS -
